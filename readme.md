This is a simple QR Code generator with some fixed parameters as my final assignment for Information Theory

I'm extremely grateful to this tutorial: https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/

Some parameters are fixed for developing sooner and easier.

Attention: for quite few inputs, this program generates wrong QR code.

Example: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

The output could be: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUEE

I guess that those fixed parameters caused this problem.
